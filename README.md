# About Me

I am registered nurse (RN) with Vanier CGS funded doctoral training in advanced synthesis and medical decision from the Dalhousie University School of Nursing.
My current role is as Director of Evidence Synthesis and Data Analytics at EVERSANA where I lead a team of over twenty statisticians to develop and execute protocols and statistical analysis plans for meta-analyses and network meta-analyses based on both aggregate and individual participant data, matching-adjusted indirect comparisons, 
simulated treatment comparisons, and a variety of predictive and causal models leveraging clinical trial and real-world data sources. My work is published in high-impact
journals including JAMA Pediatrics, Pediatrics, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. I maintain active academic collaborations focused on design and analysis of
clinical trials in neonatology and have developed and delivered training in the statistical methods for network meta-analyses for pharmaceutical and medical device companies
and delivered workshops at international conferences. Tim is an experienced JAGS and WinBUGS programmer and a lead developer for EVERSANAâ€™s IndiRect platform which powers analyses
submitted to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH), and other global national health
technology assessment bodies. This platform is also used by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), the leading national health technology assessment agency in the United States.

My doctoral research combined advanced synthesis methods with a microsimulation health economic model following infants and parents through a lifetime time-horizon to assess
the cost-effectiveness of single-family room NICUs. The economic component of this model consisted of micro-costed routine collected data from the IWK healthcare center 
alongside primary data collection of daily parental out of pocket costs and various measures of parental quality of life.
